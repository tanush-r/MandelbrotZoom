# Mandelbrot Zoom

Embark on a mind-bending voyage through the infinite wonders of the Mandelbrot set, a stunning fractal named after mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot. This p5.js project empowers you to dive deep into this mathematical marvel, unveiling hidden complexities and mesmerizing patterns through interactive exploration.

The formula used:
 f c ( z ) = z 2 + c {\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c}
## Features
<ul>
  <li><b>Real-Time Calculations:</b> You can view the Mandelbrot in real time, as the software uses frame by frame calculations to generate the beautiful, recurring fractal structure.</li>
  <li>><b>Auto-Zoom based on coordinates:</b> Enter the x and y coords and the Mandelbrot set will be zoomed, slowly tending towards the given point and unveiling the complex hidden structures within structures</li>
  <li>><b>Tweak Max Iterations and Zooming factors:</b> Edit the max iterations to generate a more detailed, recursive structure(at the cost of your computation power) and zoom in factor.</li>
</ul>
